This is the Simple Search Engine (Kotlin) project I made myself.

<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
<p>Gain confidence in your ability to work with files and the console, and learn how to optimize the search process.

In this project you will create your own search engine, though it probably won’t compete with Google. Yours will be a simple search engine that processes a limited collection of data and searches it for a word or a phrase. It’ll be simple but cool.

<b>Simple Search Engine (Kotlin) is a graduate project.</b><br>
It contains core topics for track Kotlin Developer. Apply core topics in project stages. Solve at least one graduate project to complete the track.<p>
